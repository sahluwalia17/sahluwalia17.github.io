		<p align = "justify" class = "aboutme"><strong>ABOUT ME </strong><br>Hey there! My name is Sahil Ahluwalia and I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Purdue University with a minor in mathematics. I was born and raised in the heart of the Silicon Valley in San Jose, California. Ever since I first booted up the online game Runescape, I have always had a utter fascination with computers and the means in which they operated. One of my most vivid memories at the time was when I was watching the loading screen, and across the loading bar I saw the words “Java components loading…”. I was astounded at how this mysterious phrase “Java” could power such an intricate game and if this concept could build one of my favorite games, who knew how it could be utilized in the future to build even greater things. As the rapid onset of technology aggregated in my surrounding area and major CS companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft blossomed in the area, I believed I have been poised to enter the field for a long time coming. Over the past few years, I have continued to delve into this passion by undertaking some of my own personal projects and gain real professional experience in what it would be like to be an employee in the field through internships. I believe it is safe to say that I have solidified this career path as the one that I would continue to develop the rest of my life, and hope to accomplish unimaginable heights as the field continues to grow alongside me.</p>
